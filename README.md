## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Manage the search input through the form and the input.
- Use the Wikipedia API to get the results of this search.
  I give you the endpoint (URL) because it is one of the first projects and the doc is not very clear:

https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&list=search&format=json&origin=*&srlimit=20&srsearch=${searchInput}

- Use the api using the fetch() method by including the search content here: ${searchInput}.

- Add a loader while loading.
- Display the results below the input.
- Make sure we can do as many searches as we want.
- Bonus: Handle possible errors with the fetch() method
