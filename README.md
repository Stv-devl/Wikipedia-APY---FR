## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS / SCSS
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

I learned to practice javascript.

- simple calculation for get the tip amount by people and the total amount by people.
- button effect : when we click on a new button the other one is turn off, when we click on "custom" the button is turn off.
- reset button : empty everything for start again

I learned to practice CSS :

- integrate an image inside the input

### Continued development

Next will be to build a calculator for improve the calculation with JS. And build app again and again before learn React.
